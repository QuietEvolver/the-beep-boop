### Description
_A project to create and build a programming language suggestor app according to specs:_

Output: "30, Beep!,`I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.`, I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that., 14"

## Use Case: 
A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

- Example: If a user inputs a 5, the program should display a list of values: "0", "Beep!", "Boop", "I'm Sorry...", 4, 5
